Data on the evolution of CCD pixel counts in telescopes
=======================================================

Description
-----------
`telescope-pixel-counts.csv` details the year (start of operations), the number of pixels, and the typical cycle time (time between exposures in seconds) for the CCD cameras on astronomical telescopes which are being used for major surveys.

Source
------
The data has been collated from a range of sources, usually the project website of the camera or survey in question. (TODO: list the source used for each telescope.)

* ASASSN: assume 20 cameras x 2000^2 pixels at 30 sec exposure time?

Caveats
-------
If you can think of caveats related to the use of this data, please list them here.
